# **Kubernetes Deployments and Updates**

In this chapter, we'll explore the various deployment strategies and update mechanisms in Kubernetes. We'll cover rolling updates, canary deployments, blue/green deployments, and more.

**Deployment Strategies**

A deployment strategy defines how an application is rolled out to users. Kubernetes provides several deployment strategies, including:

1. **Recreate**: Terminate all existing pods and create new ones with the updated image.
2. **RollingUpdate**: Update pods one by one, ensuring that the application remains available during the update process.
3. **Blue/Green**: Run two identical environments (blue and green) and switch traffic between them.
4. **Canary**: Roll out a new version to a small percentage of users and monitor its performance before rolling it out to the entire user base.

**Rolling Updates**

Rolling updates are a popular deployment strategy in Kubernetes. With rolling updates, Kubernetes updates pods one by one, ensuring that the application remains available during the update process.

**Key Features of Rolling Updates**

1. **Incremental updates**: Pods are updated one by one, ensuring minimal downtime.
2. **Self-healing**: If a pod fails during the update process, Kubernetes will automatically restart or replace it.
3. **Rollback**: If an update fails, Kubernetes can automatically roll back to the previous version.

**Example Rolling Update YAML**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: rolling-update-example
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: rolling-update-example
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: rolling-update-example
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: rolling-update-example
          image: nginx:1.14.2
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 1
```

**Canary Deployments**

Canary deployments involve rolling out a new version to a small percentage of users and monitoring its performance before rolling it out to the entire user base.

**Key Features of Canary Deployments**

1. **Phased rollout**: Roll out the new version to a small percentage of users first.
2. **Monitoring**: Monitor the performance of the new version before rolling it out to the entire user base.
3. **Automated rollback**: If the new version fails, automatically roll back to the previous version.

**Example Canary Deployment YAML**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: canary-deployment-example
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: canary-deployment-example
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: canary-deployment-example
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: canary-deployment-example
          image: nginx:1.15.0
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
  strategy:
    type: Canary
    canary:
      steps:
        - setWeight: 10
        - pause: { duration: 10m }
        - setWeight: 50
        - pause: { duration: 10m }
        - setWeight: 100
```

**Blue/Green Deployments**

Blue/green deployments involve running two identical environments (blue and green) and switching traffic between them.

**Key Features of Blue/Green Deployments**

1. **Two environments**: Run two identical environments (blue and green).
2. **Traffic switching**: Switch traffic between the two environments.
3. **Zero downtime**: Ensure zero downtime during the deployment process.

**Example Blue/Green Deployment YAML**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: blue-green-deployment-example
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: blue-green-deployment-example
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: blue-green-deployment-example
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: blue-green-deployment-example
          image: nginx:1.14.2
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
  strategy:
    type: BlueGreen
    blueGreen:
      active: blue
      passive: green
```

## **Canary Deployments vs Blue/Green Deployments**

Both canary deployments and blue/green deployments are popular deployment strategies used in Kubernetes, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics.

**Key Differences**

1. **Phased rollout**: Canary deployments roll out the new version to a small percentage of users, while blue/green deployments switch traffic between two environments.
2. **Environment**: Canary deployments run in the same environment as the previous version, while blue/green deployments run in separate environments.
3. **Traffic switching**: Canary deployments do not switch traffic, while blue/green deployments switch traffic between the two environments.
4. **Rollback**: Canary deployments can automatically roll back to the previous version, while blue/green deployments require manual intervention to switch back to the previous environment.

**When to Use Each**

1. **Canary Deployments**: Use canary deployments when you want to test a new version of an application with a small percentage of users before rolling it out to the entire user base.
2. **Blue/Green Deployments**: Use blue/green deployments when you want to ensure zero downtime during deployments and have a clear separation between the old and new versions of the application.

In summary, canary deployments are used for phased rollouts and testing new versions with a small percentage of users, while blue/green deployments are used for zero-downtime deployments and switching traffic between two environments.

## **Common Tools for Implementing Canary and Blue/Green Deployments**
