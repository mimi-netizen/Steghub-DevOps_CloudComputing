# **Chapter 9: Monitoring, Logging, and Troubleshooting**

In this chapter, we'll explore the essential tools and techniques for monitoring, logging, and troubleshooting in Kubernetes. We'll cover Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring, Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK stack) for logging, and various debugging techniques and common issues and solutions.

## **Prometheus and Grafana**

Prometheus is a popular monitoring tool that provides real-time metrics and alerting. Grafana is a visualization tool that integrates with Prometheus to provide dashboards and charts.

**Key Features of Prometheus**

1. **Metric collection**: Prometheus collects metrics from targets, such as nodes and pods.
2. **Alerting**: Prometheus provides alerting capabilities through Alertmanager.
3. **Multi-dimensional data model**: Prometheus uses a multi-dimensional data model to store metrics.

**Key Features of Grafana**

1. **Visualization**: Grafana provides visualization capabilities for metrics and logs.
2. **Dashboards**: Grafana supports customizable dashboards for monitoring and logging.
3. **Integration with Prometheus**: Grafana integrates with Prometheus to provide a complete monitoring solution.

**Example Prometheus YAML**

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: Prometheus
metadata:
  name: prometheus-example
spec:
  replicas: 1
  version: v2.24.1
  config:
    global:
      scrape_interval: 10s
    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: "kubernetes-nodes"
        kubernetes_sd_configs:
          - role: node
        relabel_configs:
          - source_labels: [__address__]
            regex: "(.*):10250"
            replacement: "${1}:9100"
            target_label: __address__
```

## **Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK stack)**

The EFK stack is a popular logging solution that consists of Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana.

**Key Features of Elasticsearch**

1. **Log storage**: Elasticsearch provides a scalable log storage solution.
2. **Search and filtering**: Elasticsearch supports search and filtering capabilities for logs.

**Key Features of Fluentd**

1. **Log forwarding**: Fluentd forwards logs from sources, such as nodes and pods, to Elasticsearch.
2. **Log processing**: Fluentd provides log processing capabilities, such as filtering and parsing.

**Key Features of Kibana**

1. **Visualization**: Kibana provides visualization capabilities for logs.
2. **Search and filtering**: Kibana supports search and filtering capabilities for logs.

**Example Fluentd YAML**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: fluentd-example
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: fluentd
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: fluentd
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: fluentd
          image: fluent/fluentd:v1.11.2-debian-1
          volumeMounts:
            - name: varlog
              mountPath: /var/log
            - name: varlibdockercontainers
              mountPath: /var/lib/docker/containers
```

**Debugging Techniques**

1. **kubectl describe**: Use `kubectl describe` to get detailed information about a pod or node.
2. **kubectl logs**: Use `kubectl logs` to view logs from a pod or container.
3. **Debug containers**: Use debug containers to troubleshoot issues in a pod.

**Common Issues and Solutions**

1. **Pod not running**: Check the pod's status and logs to diagnose the issue.
2. **Node not ready**: Check the node's status and logs to diagnose the issue.
3. **Deployment not rolling out**: Check the deployment's status and logs to diagnose the issue.

By mastering these tools and techniques, you'll be well-equipped to monitor, log, and troubleshoot your Kubernetes cluster.
