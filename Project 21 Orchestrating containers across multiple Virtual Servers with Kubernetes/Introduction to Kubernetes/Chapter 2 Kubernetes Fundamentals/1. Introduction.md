# Containers and Docker Basics

Before diving into Kubernetes, it's essential to understand the basics of containers and Docker.

**What is a Container?**

A container is a lightweight and portable way to package an application, its dependencies, and its settings. Containers provide a consistent and reliable way to deploy applications across different environments.

**What is Docker?**

Docker is a popular containerization platform that provides a runtime environment for containers. Docker allows you to create, deploy, and manage containers on a host operating system.

**Key Docker Concepts:**

- **Images**: A Docker image is a template for creating containers. It includes the application code, dependencies, and settings.
- **Containers**: A Docker container is an instance of a Docker image. It provides a isolated environment for the application to run.
- **Volumes**: Docker volumes allow you to persist data even after a container is deleted or recreated.
- **Ports**: Docker ports allow you to map container ports to host ports, making the application accessible from outside the container.

## Kubernetes Components

Kubernetes consists of several components that work together to provide a scalable and flexible platform for deploying applications.

### Control Plane:

The control plane is responsible for managing the cluster, including scheduling, monitoring, and maintaining the desired state of the cluster. The control plane components include:

- **API Server**: The API server provides a unified view of the cluster and allows clients to interact with the cluster.
- **Controller Manager**: The controller manager runs and manages control plane components, such as the replication controller and deployment controller.
- **Scheduler**: The scheduler is responsible for scheduling pods on available nodes.

### Nodes:

Nodes are machines that run Kubernetes components, including the control plane and worker nodes. Worker nodes are responsible for running pods and providing compute resources to the cluster.

### Kubernetes Objects

Kubernetes objects are entities that represent the state of the cluster. They can be created, updated, and deleted using the Kubernetes API.

### Pods:

A pod is the basic execution unit in Kubernetes, consisting of one or more containers. Pods are ephemeral and can be created, scaled, and deleted as needed.

### Services:

A service is a logical abstraction over a set of pods that defines a network identity and load balancing for accessing applications.

### Deployments:

A deployment is a way to manage the rollout of new versions of an application, including rolling updates and rollbacks.

### Kubernetes API and kubectl

The Kubernetes API provides a unified way to interact with the cluster, including creating, updating, and deleting objects.

**kubectl:**

kubectl is a command-line tool for interacting with the Kubernetes API. It provides a simple and intuitive way to manage the cluster, including creating and managing objects, scaling deployments, and rolling back updates.

**_Common kubectl Commands:_**

- `kubectl get`: Retrieves a list of objects, such as pods or services.

- `kubectl describe`: Provides detailed information about an object, such as a pod or deployment.

- `kubectl create`: Creates a new object, such as a pod or deployment.

- `kubectl update`: Updates an existing object, such as a deployment.

- `kubectl delete`: Deletes an object, such as a pod or deployment.

Here's an example of using kubectl to create a deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-app
          image: nginx:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

Save this YAML file as `deployment.yaml` and run the following command to create the deployment:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

This will create a new deployment named `my-app` with 3 replicas, running the latest nginx image.
