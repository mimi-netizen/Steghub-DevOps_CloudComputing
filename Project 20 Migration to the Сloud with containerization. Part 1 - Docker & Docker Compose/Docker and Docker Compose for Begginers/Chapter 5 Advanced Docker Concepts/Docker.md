5. Click `Apply` to generate the dashboard from the template.

**Step 4: Customize the Dashboard**

1. Customize the dashboard as needed, such as adding or removing panels.
2. Use the `{{ .variable }}` syntax to reference the template variables in the dashboard.

**Example: Dynamic Dashboard for Multiple Environments**

Suppose you have multiple environments, such as dev, staging, and prod, and you want to create a dynamic dashboard that can be used across all environments. You can create a template with a variable `environment` and use it to generate dashboards for each environment.

**Template:**

```yaml
{{ define "environment_dashboard" }}
  {{ range .environments }}
    {{ .Name }}:
    {{ range .Metrics }}
      {{ .Name }}: {{ .Value }}
    {{ end }}
  {{ end }}
{{ end }}
```

**Dashboard Configuration:**

```yaml
templating:
  list:
    - environments:
        - name: dev
          metrics:
            - name: CPU
              value: 50
            - name: Memory
              value: 80
        - name: staging
          metrics:
            - name: CPU
              value: 60
            - name: Memory
              value: 90
        - name: prod
          metrics:
            - name: CPU
              value: 70
            - name: Memory
              value: 95
```

**Generated Dashboard:**

The template will generate a dashboard with three panels, one for each environment, displaying the CPU and Memory metrics for each environment.

That's it! You have now created a dynamic dashboard using Grafana templates.

**Tips and Variations**

- Use template functions, such as `upper` or `lower`, to manipulate template variables.
- Use conditional statements, such as `if` or `switch`, to customize the dashboard based on template variables.
- Use loops, such as `range` or `repeat`, to generate multiple panels or rows.
- Use external data sources, such as JSON or CSV files, to populate template variables.
