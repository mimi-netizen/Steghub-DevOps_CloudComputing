- Install Wordpress and connect it to a remote MySQL database server.

## Your 3-Tier Setup

4. Redhat OS or CentOS.

NOTE: for ubuntu server, when connecting to it via SSH/Putty or any other tool, we used `ubuntu user`, but for RedHat we will use `ec2-user` user. Connection string will look like `ec2-user@<Public-IP>`.
