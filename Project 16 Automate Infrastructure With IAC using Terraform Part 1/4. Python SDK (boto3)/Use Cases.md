## **Real-World Examples**

## 1. Example 1: using boto3, S3 bucket, and Terraform:

Let's say we're building a web application that allows users to upload images. We want to store these images in an S3 bucket and use Terraform to manage the infrastructure. We'll use boto3 to interact with the S3 bucket and upload images.

**Step 1: Create an S3 bucket using Terraform**

First, we'll create an S3 bucket using Terraform:

```bash
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "image_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-image-bucket"
  acl    = "private"
}
```

This will create an S3 bucket named "my-image-bucket" in the us-west-2 region.

**Step 2: Create an IAM user and role using Terraform**

Next, we'll create an IAM user and role using Terraform:

```bash
resource "aws_iam_user" "image_uploader" {
  name = "image-uploader"
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "image_uploader_role" {
  name        = "image-uploader-role"
  description = "Role for image uploader"

  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
        Principal = {
          Service = "ec2.amazonaws.com"
        }
        Effect = "Allow"
      }
    ]
  })
}

resource "aws_iam_policy_attachment" "image_uploader_policy_attachment" {
  name       = "image-uploader-policy-attachment"
  policy_arn = aws_iam_policy.image_uploader_policy.arn
  role       = aws_iam_role.image_uploader_role.name
}

resource "aws_iam_policy" "image_uploader_policy" {
  name        = "image-uploader-policy"
  description = "Policy for image uploader"

  policy      = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = [
          "s3:GetObject",
          "s3:PutObject",
          "s3:DeleteObject"
        ]
        Resource = aws_s3_bucket.image_bucket.arn
        Effect    = "Allow"
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

This will create an IAM user named "image-uploader", an IAM role named "image-uploader-role", and an IAM policy named "image-uploader-policy" that allows the role to access the S3 bucket.

**Step 3: Use boto3 to upload images to the S3 bucket**

Now, we'll use boto3 to upload images to the S3 bucket:

```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

def upload_image(image_file):
    s3.put_object(Body=image_file, Bucket='my-image-bucket', Key='images/' + image_file.filename)

# Example usage:
image_file = open('image.jpg', 'rb')
upload_image(image_file)
```

This code uses boto3 to interact with the S3 bucket and upload an image file.

**Step 4: Deploy the infrastructure using Terraform**

Finally, we'll deploy the infrastructure using Terraform:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

This will create the S3 bucket, IAM user, IAM role, and IAM policy.

## Example 2: using boto3, S3 bucket, and Terraform to build a serverless image processing pipeline:

Let's say we're building a serverless image processing pipeline that takes in images, resizes them, and stores them in an S3 bucket. We'll use Terraform to manage the infrastructure, boto3 to interact with the S3 bucket and AWS Lambda, and AWS Lambda to resize the images.

**Step 1: Create an S3 bucket using Terraform**

First, we'll create an S3 bucket using Terraform:

```bash
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "image_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-image-bucket"
  acl    = "private"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_notification" "image_bucket_notification" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.image_bucket.id

  topics = [
    aws_sns_topic.image_processing_topic.arn
  ]

  events = [
    "s3:ObjectCreated:*"
  ]
}
```

This will create an S3 bucket named "my-image-bucket" in the us-west-2 region and configure it to send notifications to an SNS topic when an object is created.

**Step 2: Create an SNS topic using Terraform**

Next, we'll create an SNS topic using Terraform:

```bash
resource "aws_sns_topic" "image_processing_topic" {
  name = "image-processing-topic"
}
```

This will create an SNS topic named "image-processing-topic".

**Step 3: Create an AWS Lambda function using Terraform**

Now, we'll create an AWS Lambda function using Terraform:

```bash
resource "aws_lambda_function" "image_resizer" {
  filename      = "image_resizer.zip"
  function_name = "image-resizer"
  handler       = "index.handler"
  runtime      = "nodejs14.x"
  role        = aws_iam_role.image_resizer_role.arn
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "image_resizer_role" {
  name        = "image-resizer-role"
  description = "Role for image resizer"

  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
        Principal = {
          Service = "lambda.amazonaws.com"
        }
        Effect = "Allow"
      }
    ]
  })
}

resource "aws_iam_policy" "image_resizer_policy" {
  name        = "image-resizer-policy"
  description = "Policy for image resizer"

  policy      = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = [
          "s3:GetObject",
          "s3:PutObject",
          "s3:DeleteObject"
        ]
        Resource = aws_s3_bucket.image_bucket.arn
        Effect    = "Allow"
      },
      {
        Action = [
          "sns:Publish"
        ]
        Resource = aws_sns_topic.image_processing_topic.arn
        Effect    = "Allow"
      }
    ]
  })
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "image_resizer_policy_attachment" {
  role       = aws_iam_role.image_resizer_role.name
  policy_arn = aws_iam_policy.image_resizer_policy.arn
}
```

This will create an AWS Lambda function named "image-resizer" with a Node.js 14.x runtime, an IAM role named "image-resizer-role", and an IAM policy named "image-resizer-policy" that allows the Lambda function to access the S3 bucket and SNS topic.

**Step 4: Configure the Lambda function to resize images using boto3**

Now, we'll configure the Lambda function to resize images using boto3:

```python
import boto3
import os
import json

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

def handler(event, context):
    bucket_name = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
    object_key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']

    # Download the image from S3
    image_file = s3.get_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=object_key)['Body'].read()

    # Resize the image
    resized_image = resize_image(image_file)

    # Upload the resized image to S3
    s3.put_object(Body=resized_image, Bucket=bucket_name, Key=f"resized/{object_key}")

    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'statusMessage': 'Image resized successfully'
    }

def resize_image(image_file):
    # Resize the image using a library like Pillow
    from PIL import Image
    image = Image.open(image_file)
    image = image.resize((800, 600))  # Resize to 800x600
    return image.tobytes()
```

This code uses boto3 to download the image from S3, resize it using a library like Pillow, and upload the resized image back to S3.

**Step 5: Deploy the infrastructure using Terraform**

Finally, we'll deploy the infrastructure using Terraform:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

This will create the S3 bucket, SNS topic, AWS Lambda function, and IAM role and policy.
