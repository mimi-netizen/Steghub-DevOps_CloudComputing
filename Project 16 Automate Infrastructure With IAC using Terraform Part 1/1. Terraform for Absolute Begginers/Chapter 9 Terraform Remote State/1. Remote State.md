# Chapter 9: Terraform Remote State

Terraform remote state is a feature that allows you to store your Terraform state in a remote location, such as a cloud-based storage service or a Terraform-specific backend. This allows you to manage your infrastructure state across multiple environments, teams, and deployments.

## Storing State in a Remote Backend

By default, Terraform stores its state locally on your machine. However, this can lead to issues when working in teams or across multiple environments. Remote state allows you to store your state in a central location, making it easier to collaborate and manage your infrastructure.

Some popular remote backend options include:

- Terraform Cloud: A cloud-based storage service provided by HashiCorp

- AWS S3: A cloud-based object storage service

- Google Cloud Storage: A cloud-based object storage service

- Azure Blob Storage: A cloud-based object storage service

To use a remote backend, you'll need to configure your Terraform settings to point to the remote location. For example, to use Terraform Cloud, you'll need to create a Terraform Cloud account and generate an API token. You can then configure your Terraform settings using the following code:

```bash
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 0.14.0"

  backend "remote" {
    organization = "your-organization"
    workspaces {
      name = "your-workspace"
    }
  }
}
```

## Locking and Sharing State Across Teams

One of the key benefits of remote state is that it allows you to lock and share state across teams. This ensures that multiple users can collaborate on the same infrastructure without conflicts.

When you run `terraform apply`, Terraform will automatically lock the state to prevent other users from making changes while you're applying changes. Once you've completed your changes, the lock is released, allowing other users to make changes.

To share state across teams, you can create a shared workspace in Terraform Cloud or use a cloud-based storage service like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage. This allows multiple users to access and manage the same state.

## Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise

Terraform Cloud is a cloud-based service provided by HashiCorp that allows you to manage your Terraform state, collaborate with teams, and automate your infrastructure deployments. Terraform Cloud provides a range of features, including:

- State management: Store and manage your Terraform state in a central location

- Collaboration: Share state and collaborate with teams across multiple environments

- Automation: Automate your infrastructure deployments using Terraform Cloud's automation features

Terraform Enterprise is an on-premises version of Terraform Cloud that allows you to manage your Terraform state and collaborate with teams within your own infrastructure. Terraform Enterprise provides the same features as Terraform Cloud, but with the added security and control of an on-premises solution.

Some key benefits of Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise include:

- Improved collaboration: Share state and collaborate with teams across multiple environments

- Increased security: Store your state in a secure, encrypted location

- Automation: Automate your infrastructure deployments using Terraform Cloud's automation features

- Version control: Track changes to your state and roll back to previous versions as needed

### Terraform Cloud vs Terraform Enterprise: What's the Difference?

Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise are two related but distinct offerings from HashiCorp, the company behind Terraform. While they share some similarities, they cater to different use cases and provide distinct benefits. Let's break down the differences:

**Terraform Cloud**

Terraform Cloud is a SaaS (Software as a Service) platform that provides a managed environment for Terraform users. It's designed for individuals, teams, and small to medium-sized organizations that want to use Terraform without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.

**Key Features:**

1. **Managed Terraform Environment**: Terraform Cloud provides a pre-configured Terraform environment, so you don't need to worry about setting up and managing Terraform on your own infrastructure.
2. **Version Control**: Terraform Cloud includes version control features, allowing you to track changes to your Terraform configurations and collaborate with team members.
3. **State Management**: Terraform Cloud manages the Terraform state, so you don't need to worry about storing and managing the state files.
4. **Workflows**: Terraform Cloud provides pre-built workflows for common use cases, such as applying Terraform configurations and managing infrastructure deployments.
5. **Integration**: Terraform Cloud integrates with popular version control systems like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

**Terraform Enterprise**

Terraform Enterprise is a self-managed platform that provides a more comprehensive set of features and capabilities for large-scale, complex infrastructure management. It's designed for enterprises that require advanced security, scalability, and customization.

**Key Features:**

1. **Self-Managed**: Terraform Enterprise is a self-managed platform, giving you full control over the underlying infrastructure and configuration.
2. **Advanced Security**: Terraform Enterprise provides advanced security features, such as single sign-on (SSO), role-based access control (RBAC), and audit logging.
3. **Scalability**: Terraform Enterprise is designed to handle large-scale infrastructure deployments, with support for multiple Terraform workspaces and concurrent runs.
4. **Customization**: Terraform Enterprise allows for extensive customization, including custom workflows, integrations, and plugins.
5. **Private Registry**: Terraform Enterprise includes a private registry for storing and managing Terraform modules and providers.

**Key Differences:**

1. **Deployment Model**: Terraform Cloud is a SaaS platform, while Terraform Enterprise is a self-managed platform.
2. **Scalability**: Terraform Enterprise is designed for large-scale infrastructure deployments, while Terraform Cloud is suitable for smaller to medium-sized deployments.
3. **Security**: Terraform Enterprise provides advanced security features, such as SSO and RBAC, which are not available in Terraform Cloud.
4. **Customization**: Terraform Enterprise allows for more extensive customization, including custom workflows and integrations.
5. **Cost**: Terraform Cloud is generally less expensive than Terraform Enterprise, especially for smaller teams and deployments.

**When to Choose Terraform Cloud:**

- You're an individual or small team using Terraform for personal projects or small-scale infrastructure deployments.
- You want a managed Terraform environment with minimal setup and maintenance.
- You need version control and state management features.

**When to Choose Terraform Enterprise:**

- You're a large enterprise with complex infrastructure requirements.
- You need advanced security features, such as SSO and RBAC.
- You require extensive customization and scalability for large-scale infrastructure deployments.
