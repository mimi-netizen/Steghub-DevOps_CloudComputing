# COMPLEX TYPES

In Terraform, complex types are advanced data types that allow you to define more sophisticated structures for your variables, inputs, and outputs. These types are essential when working with complex infrastructure configurations or integrating with external systems.

Here are the complex types in Terraform:

**1. List of Objects (`list(object)`)**

A `list(object)` is a collection of objects, where each object is a map of key-value pairs.

Example:

```bash
variable "instances" {
  type = list(object({
    id      = string
    type    = string
    ami     = string
    subnet  = string
  }))
}
```

In this example, the `instances` variable is a list of objects, where each object has four properties: `id`, `type`, `ami`, and `subnet`.

**2. Map of Objects (`map(object)`)**

A `map(object)` is a collection of key-value pairs, where each value is an object.

Example:

```bash
variable "environments" {
  type = map(object({
    instance_type = string
    ami           = string
    subnet        = string
  }))
}
```

In this example, the `environments` variable is a map of objects, where each key is a string (e.g., "dev", "stg", "prod") and each value is an object with three properties: `instance_type`, `ami`, and `subnet`.

**3. Set of Objects (`set(object)`)**

A `set(object)` is an unordered collection of unique objects.

Example:

```bash
variable "security_groups" {
  type = set(object({
    id   = string
    name = string
  }))
}
```

In this example, the `security_groups` variable is a set of objects, where each object has two properties: `id` and `name`.

**4. Tuple (`tuple`)**

A `tuple` is a fixed-size, ordered collection of values.

Example:

```bash
variable "instance_info" {
  type = tuple([string, number, bool])
}
```

In this example, the `instance_info` variable is a tuple with three elements: a string, a number, and a boolean value.

**5. Object (`object`)**

An `object` is a single, standalone object with key-value pairs.

Example:

```bash
variable "instance" {
  type = object({
    id      = string
    type    = string
    ami     = string
    subnet  = string
  })
}
```

In this example, the `instance` variable is a single object with four properties: `id`, `type`, `ami`, and `subnet`.

These complex types allow you to model complex infrastructure configurations and integrate with external systems more effectively.

**_Let's consider a real-world example where we need to use complex types in Terraform._**

**Example: Configuring Multiple EC2 Instances with Different Settings**

Suppose we want to create multiple EC2 instances with different settings, such as instance types, AMIs, and subnets. We want to define a Terraform configuration that allows us to easily manage these instances and their settings.

Here's an example of how we can use complex types to achieve this:

```bash
# Define a list of objects to represent the EC2 instances
variable "instances" {
  type = list(object({
    instance_type = string
    ami           = string
    subnet        = string
    tags          = map(string)
  }))
}

# Define the instances
instances = [
  {
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
    ami           = "ami-abc123"
    subnet        = "subnet-0123456789abcdef0"
    tags          = {
      Name        = "Instance 1"
      Environment = "dev"
    }
  },
  {
    instance_type = "c5.xlarge"
    ami           = "ami-def456"
    subnet        = "subnet-fedcba9876543210"
    tags          = {
      Name        = "Instance 2"
      Environment = "stg"
    }
  },
  {
    instance_type = "t2.nano"
    ami           = "ami-ghi789"
    subnet        = "subnet-0123456789abcdef0"
    tags          = {
      Name        = "Instance 3"
      Environment = "prod"
    }
  }
]

# Create the EC2 instances
resource "aws_instance" "this" {
  count = length(instances)

  instance_type = instances[count.index].instance_type
  ami           = instances[count.index].ami
  subnet_id     = instances[count.index].subnet
  tags          = instances[count.index].tags
}
```

In this example, we define a list of objects `instances` that represents the EC2 instances we want to create. Each object in the list has four properties: `instance_type`, `ami`, `subnet`, and `tags`.

We then define the instances using a list of objects, where each object specifies the settings for an individual instance.

Finally, we create the EC2 instances using a `count`-based resource, where we iterate over the `instances` list and create an instance for each object in the list. We use the `count.index` variable to access the current object in the list and set the instance's properties accordingly.

**Benefits**

Using complex types in this example provides several benefits:

- **Easy instance management**: We can easily add, remove, or modify instances by updating the `instances` list.
- **Flexible instance settings**: We can define different settings for each instance, such as instance types, AMIs, and subnets.
- **Reusable code**: We can reuse this Terraform configuration to create EC2 instances with different settings in different environments.

**_After creating the EC2 instances, you can use Terraform's `output` feature to display the instance details._**

**Example: Outputting Instance Details**

```bash
# ... (rest of the code remains the same)

# Create the EC2 instances
resource "aws_instance" "this" {
  count = length(instances)

  instance_type = instances[count.index].instance_type
  ami           = instances[count.index].ami
  subnet_id     = instances[count.index].subnet
  tags          = instances[count.index].tags
}

# Output the instance details
output "instance_details" {
  value = aws_instance.this.*.id
}

output "instance_types" {
  value = aws_instance.this.*.instance_type
}

output "ami_ids" {
  value = aws_instance.this.*.ami
}

output "subnet_ids" {
  value = aws_instance.this.*.subnet_id
}

output "tags" {
  value = aws_instance.this.*.tags
}
```

In this example, we define five `output` blocks to display the instance details:

1. `instance_details`: Displays the instance IDs.
2. `instance_types`: Displays the instance types.
3. `ami_ids`: Displays the AMI IDs.
4. `subnet_ids`: Displays the subnet IDs.
5. `tags`: Displays the instance tags.

The `.*` syntax is called a "splat expression" and is used to return a list of values from a resource with a `count` meta-argument.

When you run `terraform apply`, Terraform will create the EC2 instances and then output the instance details in a human-readable format.

**Example Output**

```bash
Outputs:

ami_ids = [
  "ami-abc123",
  "ami-def456",
  "ami-ghi789",
]

instance_details = [
  "i-0123456789abcdef0",
  "i-0123456789abcdef1",
  "i-0123456789abcdef2",
]

instance_types = [
  "t2.micro",
  "c5.xlarge",
  "t2.nano",
]

subnet_ids = [
  "subnet-0123456789abcdef0",
  "subnet-fedcba9876543210",
  "subnet-0123456789abcdef0",
]

tags = [
  {
    Environment = "dev"
    Name        = "Instance 1"
  },
  {
    Environment = "stg"
    Name        = "Instance 2"
  },
  {
    Environment = "prod"
    Name        = "Instance 3"
  },
]
```

Now you can easily view the instance details after creation

**_What if you want to output additional instance attributes?_**

Terraform allows you to output additional instance attributes using the `output` feature.

**Example: Outputting Additional Instance Attributes**

```bash
# ... (rest of the code remains the same)

# Create the EC2 instances
resource "aws_instance" "this" {
  count = length(instances)

  instance_type = instances[count.index].instance_type
  ami           = instances[count.index].ami
  subnet_id     = instances[count.index].subnet
  tags          = instances[count.index].tags
}

# Output the instance details
output "instance_details" {
  value = aws_instance.this.*.id
}

output "instance_types" {
  value = aws_instance.this.*.instance_type
}

output "ami_ids" {
  value = aws_instance.this.*.ami
}

output "subnet_ids" {
  value = aws_instance.this.*.subnet_id
}

output "tags" {
  value = aws_instance.this.*.tags
}

# Output additional instance attributes
output "private_ips" {
  value = aws_instance.this.*.private_ip
}

output "public_ips" {
  value = aws_instance.this.*.public_ip
}

output "availability_zones" {
  value = aws_instance.this.*.availability_zone
}

output "instance_states" {
  value = aws_instance.this.*.instance_state
}
```

In this example, we've added four new `output` blocks to display additional instance attributes:

1. `private_ips`: Displays the private IP addresses of the instances.
2. `public_ips`: Displays the public IP addresses of the instances.
3. `availability_zones`: Displays the availability zones of the instances.
4. `instance_states`: Displays the instance states (e.g., "running", "stopped", etc.).

When you run `terraform apply`, Terraform will create the EC2 instances and then output the additional instance attributes in a human-readable format.

**Example Output**

```bash
Outputs:

ami_ids = [
  "ami-abc123",
  "ami-def456",
  "ami-ghi789",
]

availability_zones = [
  "us-west-2a",
  "us-west-2b",
  "us-west-2c",
]

instance_details = [
  "i-0123456789abcdef0",
  "i-0123456789abcdef1",
  "i-0123456789abcdef2",
]

instance_states = [
  "running",
  "running",
  "running",
]

instance_types = [
  "t2.micro",
  "c5.xlarge",
  "t2.nano",
]

private_ips = [
  "10.0.1.100",
  "10.0.2.100",
  "10.0.3.100",
]

public_ips = [
  "52.12.34.56",
  "52.12.34.57",
  "52.12.34.58",
]

subnet_ids = [
  "subnet-0123456789abcdef0",
  "subnet-fedcba9876543210",
  "subnet-0123456789abcdef0",
]

tags = [
  {
    Environment = "dev"
    Name        = "Instance 1"
  },
  {
    Environment = "stg"
    Name        = "Instance 2"
  },
  {
    Environment = "prod"
    Name        = "Instance 3"
  },
]
```

Now you can easily view the additional instance attributes after creation

**_What happens if an instance fails to launch during creation?_**

If an instance fails to launch during creation, Terraform will error and rollback the creation process.

**Error Handling**

When Terraform encounters an error during resource creation, it will:

1. Stop the creation process.
2. Roll back any changes made to the infrastructure.
3. Display an error message indicating the reason for the failure.

In the case of an instance failing to launch, the error message will typically indicate the reason for the failure, such as:

- "Error launching instance: ... (see error message for details)"

- "Instance <instance_id> failed to launch: ... (see error message for details)"

**Terraform's Behavior**

When an instance fails to launch, Terraform will:

1. Remove any partially created resources (e.g., the instance, security groups, etc.).
2. Roll back the state of the infrastructure to its previous state before the failed creation attempt.
3. Display an error message indicating the reason for the failure.

**Example Error Output**

```bash
Error: Error launching instance: Error launching instances: The instance 'i-0123456789abcdef0' failed to launch: Error waiting for instance (i-0123456789abcdef0) to become running: timeout while waiting for instance to become running

  on main.tf line 10, in resource "aws_instance" "this":
  10: resource "aws_instance" "this" {
```

In this example, Terraform encountered an error while launching an instance, and it rolled back the creation process. The error message indicates that the instance failed to launch due to a timeout while waiting for the instance to become running.

**What to Do Next**

If an instance fails to launch, you can:

1. Review the error message to understand the reason for the failure.

2. Fix the issue causing the failure (e.g., update the AMI, security group, or subnet).

3. Run `terraform apply` again to retry the creation process.

By default, Terraform will retry the creation process up to 5 times before giving up. You can adjust this behavior by setting the `retry` attribute in the `terraform` block.
