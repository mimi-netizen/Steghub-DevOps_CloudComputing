# Chapter 6: Terraform Variables

In this chapter, we'll explore Terraform variables, which allow you to parameterize your infrastructure configuration and make it more flexible and reusable.

## Using Input Variables

Input variables are values that are passed to a Terraform configuration when it's executed. They can be used to customize the behavior of your infrastructure configuration and make it more flexible.

To use an input variable, you define it in your Terraform configuration file using the `variable` keyword. For example:

```bash
variable "instance_type" {
  type        = string
  default     = "t2.micro"
  description = "The type of EC2 instance to create"
}
```

In this example, we're defining an input variable `instance_type` with a type of `string`, a default value of `"t2.micro"`, and a description.

You can then use the input variable in your Terraform configuration like this:

```bash
resource "aws_instance" "my_ec2_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-abc123"
  instance_type = var.instance_type
}
```

In this example, we're using the `instance_type` input variable to set the instance type of an EC2 instance.

## Variable Types and Default Values\*\*

Terraform supports several variable types, including:

- `string`
- `number`
- `bool`
- `list`
- `map`
- `object`
- `any`

You can specify a default value for an input variable using the `default` keyword. If no value is provided for the variable, the default value will be used.

For example:

```bash
variable "region" {
  type        = string
  default     = "us-west-2"
  description = "The AWS region to use"
}
```

In this example, the `region` input variable has a default value of `"us-west-2"`.

### Variable types supported by Terraform:

**1. `string`**

A `string` variable is a sequence of characters, such as a word, phrase, or sentence. String variables are enclosed in double quotes (`"`) and can contain letters, digits, and special characters.

Example:

```bash
variable "my_string" {
  type = string
  default = "Hello, World!"
}
```

**2. `number`**

A `number` variable is a numerical value, such as an integer or a floating-point number. Number variables can be expressed in decimal, hexadecimal, or octal notation.

Example:

```bash
variable "my_number" {
  type = number
  default = 42
}
```

**3. `bool`**

A `bool` variable is a boolean value, which can be either `true` or `false`.

Example:

```bash
variable "my_bool" {
  type = bool
  default = true
}
```

**4. `list`**

A `list` variable is a collection of values of the same type, such as a list of strings or a list of numbers. List variables are enclosed in square brackets (`[]`) and can contain multiple elements, separated by commas.

Example:

```bash
variable "my_list" {
  type = list(string)
  default = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
}
```

In this example, `my_list` is a list of strings containing three elements: "apple", "banana", and "orange".

**5. `map`**

A `map` variable is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is a string and each value is of a specific type, such as a string, number, or boolean. Map variables are enclosed in curly braces (`{}`) and can contain multiple key-value pairs, separated by commas.

Example:

```bash
variable "my_map" {
  type = map(string)
  default = {
    name  = "John Doe"
    age   = 30
    admin = true
  }
}
```

In this example, `my_map` is a map containing three key-value pairs: `name` with value "John Doe", `age` with value 30, and `admin` with value `true`.

**6. `object`**

An `object` variable is a complex data structure that can contain multiple attributes, such as strings, numbers, booleans, lists, and maps. Object variables are enclosed in curly braces (`{}`) and can contain multiple attributes, separated by commas.

Example:

```bash
variable "my_object" {
  type = object({
    name  = string
    age   = number
    admin = bool
    addresses = list(string)
  })
  default = {
    name  = "John Doe"
    age   = 30
    admin = true
    addresses = ["123 Main St", "456 Elm St"]
  }
}
```

In this example, `my_object` is an object containing four attributes: `name` with value "John Doe", `age` with value 30, `admin` with value `true`, and `addresses` with value `["123 Main St", "456 Elm St"]`.

**7. `any`**

An `any` variable is a special type that can hold any value, including strings, numbers, booleans, lists, maps, and objects. Any variables are useful when you need to pass a value of unknown type to a module or function.

Example:

```bash
variable "my_any" {
  type = any
  default = "Hello, World!" // or 42, or true, or [...], etc.
}
```

In this example, `my_any` is an any variable that can hold any value, such as a string, number, boolean, or other types.

It's worth noting that when using `any` variables, you should be careful when accessing or manipulating the value, as Terraform won't perform any type checking or validation.

**Variable Files and Environments**

Variable files are files that contain input variable values. They can be used to separate input variable values from your Terraform configuration files.

Terraform supports two types of variable files:

- `terraform.tfvars`: This file contains input variable values in a simple key-value format.

- `terraform.tfvars.json`: This file contains input variable values in JSON format.

You can use variable files to define input variable values for different environments, such as development, staging, and production.

For example, you could create a `terraform.tfvars` file for your development environment:

```makefile
instance_type = "t2.nano"
region        = "us-west-1"
```

And another `terraform.tfvars` file for your production environment:

```makefile
instance_type = "c5.xlarge"
region        = "us-east-1"
```

You can then use the `terraform env` command to select the environment you want to use:

```bash
terraform env dev
```

This will tell Terraform to use the input variable values from the `terraform.tfvars` file in your development environment.

**Best Practices**

Here are some best practices for using Terraform variables:

- **Use descriptive variable names**: Use descriptive names for your input variables to make it clear what they represent.
- **Use default values**: Use default values for input variables to make it easier to use your Terraform configuration.
- **Use variable files**: Use variable files to separate input variable values from your Terraform configuration files.
- **Use environments**: Use environments to define input variable values for different environments, such as development, staging, and production.
